# Password Generator

For this assignment, we were given a password generator which didn't work. We were tasked adding the necessary code to make it a fully functional password generator. Post class end, I've now edited the source code. Originally the site was designed to get input from the user using a series of alerts and prompts. I modified the source code to be more user-friendly. Now using checkboxes and input fields to get input from the user as opposed to alerts. 

### Prerequisites

In order to test out the generator, you'll need a device with internet connection, and a browser.

## Getting Started

I've included screenshots of what the site looks like and all the options available. The site is also linked below so feel free to take a look! 
Upon initially loading in to the site, you will see this:

From here you can select your desired password options.

Finally, the password will be generated according to your choices:

Once the password has been generated, you can click on the copy button to copy it to your clipboard:

If you were to navigate the site incorrectly, you may end up seeing one of these error messages:
