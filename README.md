# Password Generator

For this assignment, we were given a password generator which didn't work. We were tasked adding the necessary code to make it a fully functional password generator. 

### Prerequisites

In order to test out the generator, you'll need a device with internet connection, and a browser.

## Getting Started

I've included screenshots of what the site looks like and all the prompts you'll see as you go through the process of genrating password. The site is also linked below so feel free to take a look!
Upon initially loading in to the site, you will see this:
